# Benchmarking general decision-making with open & random worlds

## Why a Xenoverse Instead of a Single Universe?

**Enhancing Generalization Over Memorization:** Recent research indicates that the generalization ability of learning agents primarily depends on the diversity of training environments. However, the real world imposes significant limitations on this diversity, such as physical laws and insufficient variety in environments, tasks, and embodiments. These limitations present a serious bottleneck to advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI). Xenoverse is a collection of extremely diverse worlds generated procedurally based on completely random parameters. We propose that AGI should not be trained and adapted within a single universe but rather within Xenoverse.

**Avoid Overfitting Specific Benchmarks**: Xenoverse can be used for both **Meta-Training** and **Open-World Evaluation**. Existing benchmarks are typically closed-set and tend to be overfitted soon after their introduction. In contrast, Xenoverse provides open-world benchmarks that are **theoretically impossible to overfit**, making them effective tools for evaluating generalization capabilities.
